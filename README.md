# üåê React TanStack Query Examples

This project is a showcase of modern **data fetching techniques** in **React**, leveraging the powerful **TanStack Query** (formerly React Query) for handling server-side state and caching with ease.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Traditional Method**: Demonstrates data fetching using vanilla `fetch` or similar techniques.
- **React Query Integration**: A clean and efficient approach to data fetching, caching, synchronization, and updating UI with **React Query**.
- **Pagination**: Seamless implementation of paginated data fetching using React Query for better performance.
- **Button Scroll Loading**: Example of loading more content on-demand via a button click.
- **Infinite Scroll**: Implementation of infinite scrolling with **React Query**, automatically fetching more data as the user scrolls down.
